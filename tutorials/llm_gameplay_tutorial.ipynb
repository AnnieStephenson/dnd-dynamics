      "Turn 68 - Pizza: OOC: I forgot about the goliath not you Finland sorry about that\n",
      "Turn 69 - Dungeon Master: Gundren says \"I need you to watch a caravan on its way to Aura. And I want you to watch for anything that looks dangerous. DO NOT OPEN THE CHEST. What is in it is very powerfull and I don't need you messing with it. When you get to Aura, 4 wizards from the mage tower will be waiting for you at the front gate. Any other questions before we go? We must leave soon if we want to get to Aura before sounder (Sunday. It is currently friday or frounder) so I will only take one question.\n",
      "Turn 70 - Finlan: Nope I'm good with that.  replies Finlan. At this time Finlan is still staring daggers at the tiefling.\n",
      "Turn 71 - Dungeon Master: Gundren says \"ok then let's go. The caravan will be waiting outside the gate.\" And he starts leaving the inn.\n",

      "Turn 73 - Dungeon Master: OOC wait your just a pizza. A living pizza?\n",
      "Turn 74 - Finlan: Oh, well I guess that makes sense...  says Finlan, slightly confused.\n",
      "Turn 75 - Pizza: OOC: Yup! Backstory: My bones are the crust, my skin is the sause, my hair is the cheese, and my eyes are the pepperoni. I am... Pizza Pepperoni\n",
      "Turn 76 - Cororin: I ask gundrun \"so if this item is so dangerous then why is it not being protected by a full gaurd from solitaire instead of four people that have never worked together?\"\n",
      "Turn 77 - Pizza: \"Probably because we are going to be traveling though bandit country and if it was heavily guarded the bandits would know they were guarding something valuable and ambush them and take the box\"\n",
      "Turn 78 - Masque: Masque speaks up.  \"Is this a situation where the item has high personal value but little intrinsic value otherwise?\"\n",
      "Turn 79 - Dungeon Master: he turns around and says \" both. high personal and money value. now we rely should leave if we want to get their by sounder.\"\n",
      "Turn 80 - Masque: Milamber stands and leaves a coin for his drink on the table. Then grabbing his things he begins to head towards the door.\n",

      "Turn 84 - Dungeon Master: Gundren leads you all outside though the city out the gate onto a caravan. And says \"sit wherever you want but I need one of you to drive the caravan.\" A half orc on a horse rides over and gundren says. \"Slork and I will ride ahead as scouts.\" A man walks a horse with a red line on its head, then walks away. Gundren gets on the horse and he and slork ride away after you guys get positioned. DM- who is driving? And where are the rest of you? 2 people can sit upfront. People can walk on the side if you want, and the caravan has an opining in the back so you can see.\n",
      "Turn 85 - Finlan: Finlan will hop up into the cart.\n",
      "Turn 86 - Masque: Masque will climb up as well. He will then look at the horses and then the others. \"Shall I drive or did one of you want to?\n",

      "Turn 91 - Pizza: \"I may not be a person but I still have a gender, take a dog as an example, its not a person but it still has a gender. By the way I am a tiefling. Also how do you know my name I've never told you.\" OOC: My character never mentioned there name.\n",
      "Turn 92 - Finlan: (OoC CuZ I CaN REdz MinedZ!! -I don't know how I'll fix what I said without ruining the script so we'll have to go with it) Eh, we haflings are smarter than we look.\n",

      "Turn 94 - Masque: Climbing into the back of the wagon Masque sits next to the chest and Waits for the trip to begin.\n",
      "Turn 95 - Dungeon Master: Finlan is in thed cart, masque is next to the chest, pizza is walking on the side, and cororin is driving and gundren rides off and so do you. It's been a day and a half and your still on the road. You've stoped and had food and took a rest. Cororin and pizza make a perception check.\n",
      "Turn 96 - Pizza: 7\n",
      "Turn 97 - Cororin: 8\n",
      "Turn 98 - Dungeon Master: You see nothing. But eventually get so close you almost run over two horse's sprawls on the ground.\n",
      "Turn 99 - Finlan: Ha! Look at those horses! Isn't it so cute when they pretend to play dead to try and please us?\n",
      "Finlan: Finlan, a halfling barbarian, comes across as jovial, curious, and somewhat naive. He's drawn to the promise of a large reward, suggesting a practical, perhaps even mercenary, motivation. His initial excitement at joining a team and his humorous observations about the party composition indicate a lighthearted and sociable nature. He seems easily amused and enjoys banter, though he can be easily annoyed, as seen by his reaction to being left out of the count of people. He expresses confusion when Pizza reveals she is not a person, showcasing a literal-mindedness. He seems to value fairness and is willing to stand up for himself, even if in a humorous way. He enjoys drinking dwarven ale more than the halfling variety. He is easily distracted and gullible.\n",

      "Masque: Masque Deathsbane, a Githzerai cleric, is portrayed as calm, studious, and diplomatic. His backstory reveals a love for learning, specifically within the libraries of Aura. His reason for taking the job is simply to travel to Solitaire for a visit, and get paid to come back. He prioritizes acquiring knowledge and intends to return to Aura, indicating a strong connection to the city and its resources. In social situations, Masque acts as a mediator, attempting to diffuse tension with a soothing voice and offers of civility. He shows concern for the nature of the item being transported, questioning its value, suggesting a thoughtful and cautious nature.\n",

      "Cororin: Cororin, a goliath barbarian, immediately establishes himself as a chaotic and potentially dangerous presence. His backstory involves actively seeking opportunities to kill people, marking him as chaotic evil. He shows little regard for social norms, barging into the inn and aggressively demanding information. His interactions with Pizza reveal a confrontational and somewhat crude personality. He's skeptical of the mission, questioning why such a valuable item isn't better guarded. He values strength and doesn't hesitate to intimidate or threaten others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pizza: Pizza Pepperoni, a tiefling rogue, is playful and quick-witted. Her backstory is inherently humorous, revealing that she is essentially a sentient pizza. The fact that she is named \"Pizza Pepperoni\" and that the player acknowledges the humour of writing her name suggests a light-hearted approach to the game. She is motivated by the promise of money, indicating a pragmatic side. She is self-conscious and hides her face. She is bothered by Cororin referring to her as an \"it\".\n",
