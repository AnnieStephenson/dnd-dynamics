      "  🗡️  Jinx (druid): A devout and passionate dwarven paladin from the Ximesi Mountains, Jinx comes from a proud lineage of female warriors who serve as council members and healers. Despite her youth and eagerness, she carries herself with martial discipline and religious conviction. Her faith in Ximesi (deity of Light and Fire) drives her actions, though she can be quick to judge and slow to trust, especially those who don't share her rigid moral code. The darkness that once infected her elders left a deep mark on her people, fueling her zealous dedication to fighting evil. While confident in battle and diplomatic matters, she struggles to relate to those with different worldviews, though she genuinely desires to protect and serve as a guardian.\n",

      "  🗡️  Faen (Warlock): A socially awkward moon elf warlock with a complex past as a noble's daughter. Born physically frail and magically stunted, she was kept isolated by her controlling father who saw her as an embarrassment. She found companionship in a mysterious entity called Bastion who granted her warlock powers, leading to her exile when she refused to break their pact. She exhibits two distinct personalities - her natural shy, proper demeanor from her noble upbringing, and a darker, more confident presence when Bastion's influence emerges. Despite her troubled background, she shows genuine curiosity about the world and a desire to prove her worth, though she struggles with abandonment issues and social interactions.\n",

      "  🗡️  Dmitrei (Druid): A thoughtful and diplomatic human druid from the Aerith Tundra, where he worked in his family's leather shop while secretly training with a mysterious owl druid mentor. He believes strongly in destiny but approaches it with humility rather than ego. His practical experience with crafting and herbs combines with his druidic powers, making him both a healer and mediator within the group. He shows particular reverence for the natural world and often tries to find peaceful solutions, though he's capable in combat when necessary. His personality tends toward the diplomatic, often trying to bridge divides between his more confrontational companions.\n",

      "  🗡️  Thokk (Barbarian): A complex half-orc barbarian raised by pirates, marked deeply by witnessing his mother's execution and the destruction of his adoptive family. Despite his gruff exterior and tendency toward violence, he shows a surprising depth of emotional intelligence about justice and morality, believing that true evil often hides behind law and authority. He struggles with anger management but has a soft spot for the downtrodden, having experienced extreme hardship himself. His interactions reveal an unexpected gentleness, particularly toward Faen, though he maintains a tough exterior. His philosophy centers on direct action and personal judgment rather than societal rules.\n",
