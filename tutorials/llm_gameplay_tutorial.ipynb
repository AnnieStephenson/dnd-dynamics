    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the LLM-based D&D simulation system to create AI-driven gameplay sessions based on real human campaign data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation system includes:\n",
    "- **Campaign Parameter Extraction**: Analyze human campaigns to extract initialization parameters\n",
    "- **Character Creation**: Generate D&D characters with personalities and classes\n",
    "- **Turn Sampling**: Create realistic turn sequences using various sampling methods\n",
    "- **Character Agents**: LLM-powered characters with memory and decision-making\n",
    "- **Game Session Management**: Orchestrate complete D&D scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install required packages: `pip install anthropic`\n",
    "2. Set your Anthropic API key: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here`\n",
    "3. Ensure you have access to the human campaign data files"

If you are interested, please post a character concept including  name ,  race ,  class , and  background . Furthermore, please include a  brief  answer to the question:  Why are you a guardian?

Generally, I want people to take turns and detail their actions only for their own character. Hopefully this creates a flow of character actions followed by a post by me that summarizes the events and the results. This tends to mean that players need to commit to posting regularly enough that the group doesn't have to wait a long time for their turn. Usually, we'll establish a rule for how long we'll wait for one person before just moving on. If you have any questions, feel free to send me a message.

Tetna Riverlands : In the south-east region of the continent, where the land meets the sea, lies the fertile river lands of Tetna. Humans have settled this region. They've built cities, farming communities, and trading posts all throughout the land. Many other races have come to live in the comfort of the river lands including halflings and hill dwarves. Maha Islands : In the southernmost reaches of the continent are a chain of islands called Maha. These islands are sparsely populated by tribes of half-orc seafarers.\\xa0\\xa0  Gopmara Swamp : Many are wary of the southwestern swamp of Gopmara. It is the home of the secluded and suspicious dark elves. Koatel Desert : The shifting sand dunes and constant heat of the far west make up the Koatel Desert. A clan of outcast nomads called Tieflings reside here. Aerith Tundra : The white winds and snow of the north are home to few. Some brawny tribes of mountain dwarves and humans live here.
