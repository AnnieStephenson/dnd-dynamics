Wanting to visit Solitaire anyway he decided that he would go there to see it and might as well get paid to come back. After all, all the best libraries are in Aura and he knew he would want to come back.

He hoped it wouldn't be too long but to stave off boredom he pulls a book out of his bag and begins to read while he waits.\n",
      "Turn 39 - Dungeon Master: What about the rest of you\n",
      "Turn 40 - Finlan: Finlan will wait in the inn as well ordering some dwarven ale. Over the year's he's discovered he likes theirs the best, more so than the light stuff that haflings brew.\n",
      "Turn 41 - Finlan: Wow, we have a humongous goliath barbarian and a tiny hafling barbarian. This whole group is hilarious. Just think about how good Masque's heals are going to be on us XD.\n",

Finlan will then turn back to the strange creature before him. It looks like the three of us are all here looking for him. Care if I join you? While waiting Finlan will see if he can recall what creature this man is. 3\n",

      "Turn 56 - Finlan: (How much do I owe for my drink?)\n",

      "Turn 63 - Finlan: I have one! You said the reward was large.  How  large is it?  asks Finlan curiously.\n",
      "Turn 64 - Dungeon Master: He says \"enough to set you up FOR LIFE. Any more questions?\"\n",
      "Turn 65 - Pizza: \"Are you disappointed that there are only three people who answered you letter?\"\n",
      "Turn 66 - Finlan: Hey I'm a person to!!!  Finlan yells angrily.\n",
      "Turn 67 - Masque: Shaking his head at the other responses Masque speaks.  \"Gundren, What exactly do you need us to do and what do you want us to watch for?\"\n",
      "Turn 68 - Pizza: OOC: I forgot about the goliath not you Finland sorry about that\n",
      "Turn 69 - Dungeon Master: Gundren says \"I need you to watch a caravan on its way to Aura. And I want you to watch for anything that looks dangerous. DO NOT OPEN THE CHEST. What is in it is very powerfull and I don't need you messing with it. When you get to Aura, 4 wizards from the mage tower will be waiting for you at the front gate. Any other questions before we go? We must leave soon if we want to get to Aura before sounder (Sunday. It is currently friday or frounder) so I will only take one question.\n",
      "Turn 70 - Finlan: Nope I'm good with that.  replies Finlan. At this time Finlan is still staring daggers at the tiefling.\n",
      "Turn 71 - Dungeon Master: Gundren says \"ok then let's go. The caravan will be waiting outside the gate.\" And he starts leaving the inn.\n",
      "Turn 72 - Pizza: \"Finlan I'm not a person\"\n",
      "Turn 73 - Dungeon Master: OOC wait your just a pizza. A living pizza?\n",
      "Turn 74 - Finlan: Oh, well I guess that makes sense...  says Finlan, slightly confused.\n",
      "Turn 75 - Pizza: OOC: Yup! Backstory: My bones are the crust, my skin is the sause, my hair is the cheese, and my eyes are the pepperoni. I am... Pizza Pepperoni\n",
      "Turn 76 - Cororin: I ask gundrun \"so if this item is so dangerous then why is it not being protected by a full gaurd from solitaire instead of four people that have never worked together?\"\n",
      "Turn 77 - Pizza: \"Probably because we are going to be traveling though bandit country and if it was heavily guarded the bandits would know they were guarding something valuable and ambush them and take the box\"\n",
      "Turn 78 - Masque: Masque speaks up.  \"Is this a situation where the item has high personal value but little intrinsic value otherwise?\"\n",
      "Turn 79 - Dungeon Master: he turns around and says \" both. high personal and money value. now we rely should leave if we want to get their by sounder.\"\n",
      "Turn 80 - Masque: Milamber stands and leaves a coin for his drink on the table. Then grabbing his things he begins to head towards the door.\n",
      "Turn 81 - Finlan: Finlan follows.\n",
      "Turn 82 - Pizza: \"Let's go\"  Pizza says and follows Finlan\n",
      "Turn 83 - Cororin: \"well let's do this thing.\"\n",
      "Turn 84 - Dungeon Master: Gundren leads you all outside though the city out the gate onto a caravan. And says \"sit wherever you want but I need one of you to drive the caravan.\" A half orc on a horse rides over and gundren says. \"Slork and I will ride ahead as scouts.\" A man walks a horse with a red line on its head, then walks away. Gundren gets on the horse and he and slork ride away after you guys get positioned. DM- who is driving? And where are the rest of you? 2 people can sit upfront. People can walk on the side if you want, and the caravan has an opining in the back so you can see.\n",
      "Turn 85 - Finlan: Finlan will hop up into the cart.\n",
      "Turn 86 - Masque: Masque will climb up as well. He will then look at the horses and then the others. \"Shall I drive or did one of you want to?\n",
      "Turn 87 - Finlan: Pizza can't, apparently he's not a person...\n",
      "Turn 88 - Cororin: \"i will\".\n",
      "Turn 89 - Pizza: \"I am a she.\" Pizza will walk next to the cart.\n",
      "Turn 90 - Finlan: Silly Pizza, it thinks it's a person so it can call itself a she...  Finlan says quite amused.\n",
      "Turn 91 - Pizza: \"I may not be a person but I still have a gender, take a dog as an example, its not a person but it still has a gender. By the way I am a tiefling. Also how do you know my name I've never told you.\" OOC: My character never mentioned there name.\n",
      "Turn 92 - Finlan: (OoC CuZ I CaN REdz MinedZ!! -I don't know how I'll fix what I said without ruining the script so we'll have to go with it) Eh, we haflings are smarter than we look.\n",
      "Turn 93 - Pizza: OOC:OK Pizza rolls her eyes.\n",
      "Turn 94 - Masque: Climbing into the back of the wagon Masque sits next to the chest and Waits for the trip to begin.\n",
      "Turn 95 - Dungeon Master: Finlan is in thed cart, masque is next to the chest, pizza is walking on the side, and cororin is driving and gundren rides off and so do you. It's been a day and a half and your still on the road. You've stoped and had food and took a rest. Cororin and pizza make a perception check.\n",
      "Turn 96 - Pizza: 7\n",
      "Turn 97 - Cororin: 8\n",
      "Turn 98 - Dungeon Master: You see nothing. But eventually get so close you almost run over two horse's sprawls on the ground.\n",
      "Turn 99 - Finlan: Ha! Look at those horses! Isn't it so cute when they pretend to play dead to try and please us?\n",
      "Finlan: Finlan, the halfling barbarian, is a jovial and curious individual, easily amused and eager for adventure, particularly when a large reward is involved. He seems to have a fondness for dwarven ale and a playful, almost teasing, attitude towards his companions. He is quick to size up individuals, keeping a wary eye on Cororin, the chaotic evil Goliath, and poking fun at Pizza's unique existence. He's friendly and relatively trusting. He seems to be money-driven. His backstory includes checking \"Help Wanted\" boards for missions, suggesting he's accustomed to mercenary work and likely travels often. He does not like being excluded and quickly jumps to defend himself after being excluded by the Dwarf.\n",
      "\n",
      "Masque: Masque Deathsbane, the Githzerai cleric, is a calm and collected individual, exhibiting a scholarly demeanor and a desire for peaceful resolutions. He is level-headed and tries to mediate conflicts between the more chaotic members of the group. Driven by a love for knowledge, he seems to primarily work with the group for transport to the library in Aura. His actions highlight a focus on diplomacy and a willingness to help others, particularly through healing. He seems selfless and content with his place in the party, happy to wait and read. He values knowledge and intellectual pursuits over riches or personal gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cororin: Cororin, the Goliath barbarian, is a chaotic evil character with a penchant for violence and theft. He openly admits to his evil alignment and displays a confrontational attitude, attempting to pickpocket Pizza and threatening violence. He seems driven by a desire for money, though his methods are far from honest. Cororin is impulsive and enjoys intimidating others, often using his size to his advantage. He cares little for the well-being of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pizza: Pizza Pepperoni, the tiefling rogue, is defined by her unusual physical makeup and a somewhat defensive, though humorous, personality. She is very self-conscious, hiding her face upon first meeting her party and is quick to defend herself when questioned about her nature. She has a dry sense of humor, evident in her comments and reactions to the other characters. Although clearly concerned with money, she is cautious. Her background as a living pizza made of crust, sauce, cheese, and pepperoni gives her a unique perspective and likely shapes her interactions with others.\n",
