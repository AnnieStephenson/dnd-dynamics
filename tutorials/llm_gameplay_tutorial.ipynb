    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the LLM-based D&D simulation system to create AI-driven gameplay sessions based on real human campaign data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation system includes:\n",
    "- **Campaign Parameter Extraction**: Analyze human campaigns to extract initialization parameters\n",
    "- **Character Creation**: Generate D&D characters with personalities and classes\n",
    "- **Turn Sampling**: Create realistic turn sequences using various sampling methods\n",
    "- **Character Agents**: LLM-powered characters with memory and decision-making\n",
    "- **Game Session Management**: Orchestrate complete D&D scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install required packages: `pip install anthropic`\n",
    "2. Set your Anthropic API key: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here`\n",
    "3. Ensure you have access to the human campaign data files"
