His introduction to the story—attempting to pick-pocket a fellow party member and then threatening her when caught—immediately establishes his morally questionable character. He admits to wandering town at dusk hoping to attract would-be robbers that he could kill, suggesting he actively seeks violence. Despite his intimidating presence and aggressive tendencies, Cororin shows moments of unexpected competence, like his impressive medicine check to fix his own dislocated shoulder. His impulsiveness frequently causes problems for the group, such as when he noisily revealed their position while tracking goblins. Though generally menacing, he demonstrates a surprising desire to keep an enemy goblin alive for questioning rather than killing it outright. Cororin's contradictions suggest a complex background—perhaps a tribal outcast or someone who learned to survive through intimidation and violence but retains some pragmatic understanding of when cooperation serves his interests better than conflict.\n",
