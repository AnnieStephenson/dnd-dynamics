    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the LLM-based D&D simulation system to create AI-driven gameplay sessions based on real human campaign data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation system includes:\n",
    "- **Campaign Parameter Extraction**: Analyze human campaigns to extract initialization parameters\n",
    "- **Character Creation**: Generate D&D characters with personalities and classes\n",
    "- **Turn Sampling**: Create realistic turn sequences using various sampling methods\n",
    "- **Character Agents**: LLM-powered characters with memory and decision-making\n",
    "- **Game Session Management**: Orchestrate complete D&D scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install required packages: `pip install anthropic`\n",
    "2. Set your Anthropic API key: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here`\n",
    "3. Ensure you have access to the human campaign data files"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "🎉 **Congratulations!** You've successfully run a complete LLM-based D&D simulation!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **✅ Parameter Extraction**: Analyzed a real human campaign to extract player count and structure\n",
    "2. **✅ Character Creation**: Generated AI characters with distinct personalities and classes\n",
    "3. **✅ Turn Sampling**: Created a realistic turn sequence using uniform sampling\n",
    "4. **✅ Memory Management**: Each character maintained context and memory across turns\n",
    "5. **✅ Interactive Gameplay**: Characters responded to situations and each other naturally\n",
    "6. **✅ Session Management**: Complete game log with timestamps and turn tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features Demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-agent LLM system**: Each character has their own Claude client\n",
    "- **Memory persistence**: Characters remember past events and update their knowledge\n",
    "- **Turn-based interaction**: Realistic D&D-style turn sequence\n",
    "- **Extensible architecture**: Easy to add new sampling methods, character extraction, etc.\n",
    "- **Real campaign integration**: Parameters derived from actual human gameplay\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🔮 Extract character data**: Pull actual character names/classes from human campaigns\n",
    "- **📈 Advanced sampling**: Implement activity-based or weighted turn sampling\n",
    "- **🧠 Enhanced memory**: Add verbatim recent events + summarized older events\n",
    "- **🎪 Richer scenarios**: Create more complex, multi-scene adventures\n",
    "- **📊 Analysis tools**: Compare AI gameplay patterns to human campaigns\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation framework is now ready for more sophisticated experiments with emergent AI behavior in D&D settings!"
