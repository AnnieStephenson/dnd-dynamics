      "  🗡️  Jinx (druid): Lucinda \"Jinx\" Brightwell is a fiery and confident mountain dwarf with a penchant for action and a strong belief in her destiny as a Guardian. Born in the Ximesi Mountains, her clan has a legacy of service, and she bears the weight of that responsibility with pride. Her faith in Ximesi, the sage of mountains, fuels her bravery and sense of duty, though her impatience sometimes borders on recklessness. Jinx was driven to join the Guardians by the darkness that once plagued her home and the desire to prevent any similar threats. She exudes enthusiasm and a battle-ready demeanor, wielding her maul with a fierce determination. Jinx's personality is as fiery as her red hair, often inspiring those around her, even if her eager nature can occasionally lead her into hasty decisions.\n",

      "  🗡️  Faen (Warlock): Faral \"Faen\" Hanali is a complex half-elf warlock, born into a noble lineage among moon elves. Her pale complexion and frail constitution made her an outcast, perceived as weak and strange by her village. Though she found solace in a mysterious voice that became her constant companion, it led her to forge a pact, granting her powers but deepening her isolation. Faen's idealistic yet introspective nature drives her to protect other outcasts, and she sees her role as a Guardian as a chance to prove her worth and her powers as a gift. She is soft-spoken and polite but harbors an underlying strength, guided by her inner voice, Bastion, which both comforts and challenges her. Her interactions are sometimes awkward and self-conscious, reflecting her lifelong struggle for acceptance.\n",

His family occupied the valuable role of leathermakers, a trade that fostered Dmitrei's deep connection to nature and the land. A mentor's prophecy and training prepared him for his destiny as a Guardian, a path he accepts with a calm humility derived from his tundra origins. Dmitrei is practical and prudent, always seeking harmony with his surroundings and advocating for collective strength in his group. His druidic powers and the totemic gifts from the land reflect his deep spirituality and commitment to protecting the natural world from darkness. Despite being a reliable team member, his journey is marked by his ambition to live up to the destiny foretold by his mentor.\n",

      "  🗡️  Thokk (Barbarian): Thokk is a formidable and passionate half-orc barbarian, whose life has been defined by loss and survival. Born into a pirate clan led by his fearsome mother, Thokk experienced a childhood filled with camaraderie, adventure, and unorthodox education until betrayal dismantled his world. Witnessing the execution of his family instilled in him a rejection of senseless violence and a profound sense of justice, however unconventional his methods may be. While Thokk is outwardly gruff and fearsome in battle, he wrestles privately with his emotions and the burden of his past. He has a strong sense of what is fair and just, using his strength to defend those unable to protect themselves. His interactions, especially with those he is passionate about, are marked by awkward vulnerability masked by bravado.\n",
