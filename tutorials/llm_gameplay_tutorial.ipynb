    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the LLM-based D&D simulation system to create AI-driven gameplay sessions based on real human campaign data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation system includes:\n",
    "- **Campaign Parameter Extraction**: Analyze human campaigns to extract initialization parameters\n",
    "- **Character Creation**: Generate D&D characters with personalities and classes\n",
    "- **Turn Sampling**: Create realistic turn sequences using various sampling methods\n",
    "- **Character Agents**: LLM-powered characters with memory and decision-making\n",
    "- **Game Session Management**: Orchestrate complete D&D scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install required packages: `pip install anthropic`\n",
    "2. Set your Anthropic API key: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here`\n",
    "3. Ensure you have access to the human campaign data files"

      "I arrived at a tavern with my fellow adventurers - the warrior Aria, the wizard Gandalf, and the cleric Lyra. An ominous tension filled the place, with the innkeeper Pip acting anxious and a cloaked stranger lurking suspiciously. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aria suggested finding a table near the exit, sword at the ready in case of trouble. Gandalf sensed darker forces at work beyond what was visible. He commanded the cloaked figure to reveal itself while preparing to counter any hostile magic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Approaching the bar, Aria questioned Pip firmly about the strange happenings, neither threatening nor backing down. Gandalf urged the innkeeper to speak truthfully about any evil plaguing the tavern, warning of a wizard's wrath if deceived. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lyra tried to defuse the situation, offering Pip solace and pledging to aid against malign influences through her divine grace. But she also made it clear wickedness would be purged without mercy if he conspired against us.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a cunning rogue, I remained vigilant throughout, carefully watching the tense confrontation while positioning myself to react quickly to any threats that emerged. I am ready to provide stealthy scouting, or strike decisively from the shadows if combat erupts.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf (Wizard):\n",
      "Memory: *strokes beard sagely, reassured by the principled stances of my noble companions* Indeed, the tension thickens here like a noxious fog, and we must pierce its miasmic veil with both prudence and resolve. I am heartened that Lyra and Aria have extended overtures of parley and protection to the unsettled innkeeper Pip, providing a path toward truthful account and cooperative alliance against any corrupting influences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lyra's radiant aura suffuses the tavern with soothing reassurance, a balm to disquieted spirits. She has wisely proffered sanctuary and compassion to the fearful Pip, should he elect to reveal what shadows burden this place. Yet she also stands fortified with righteous power, ready to unleash purifying light upon any unrepentant wickedness.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Aria's warrior soul burns undaunted, her loyal blade ready to defend us if the need arises. She has laid down an ultimatum in blunt but just terms - full transparency will be met with our steadfast guardianship, but any deceit or malefaction shall earn merciless reprisal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Though their approaches differ in tenor, both my companions uphold honor and courage. Pip has been given fair opportunity to cast off secrecy and unite with our noble cause. I can only hope wisdom prevails over any misguided loyalties, lest we be forced to unsheathe the full extent of our formidable gifts in battle against the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, I await Pip's reckoning with baited breath, staff gripped firmly, arcane might marshaled - yet still aspiring that dialogue may chart a brighter path forward. Whatever ominous forces haunt this place shall be defied, one way or another, by our stalwart fellowship.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Lyra (Cleric):\n",
      "Memory: *As the compassionate Cleric Lyra, I watch the confrontation unfold with a mixture of wariness and concern for a peaceful resolution.* \n",
      "\n",
      "My stalwart companion Aria has taken the lead, firmly questioning the innkeeper Pip about the ominous undercurrents and shady stranger cloaked in the corner. With hand on sword hilt, she demands full truthfulness from Pip, making it clear we are seasoned adventurers able to discern deception. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aria issues Pip an ultimatum - either cooperate fully by revealing any lurking evil forces so we can aid in banishing them, or face harsh reprisal if he conspires against us. The gravity in her voice and the resolve in her eyes show she will not hesitate to battle any threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wise wizard Gandalf stands by, his staff aglow, ready to unleash mystic power against malign entities. Though committed to peaceful solutions, I too will call upon divine radiance to smite wickedness if pressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tensions are perilously high as we await Pip's response. I pray he will make the wise choice to be forthright, accepting our offer of protection in exchange for full disclosure. But I also steadily prepare to defend my companions from any evil that may be unmasked. Wisdom and compassion guide my cause, but righteous force will be deployed without hesitation against the forces of darkness.\n",

    "üéâ **Congratulations!** You've successfully run a complete LLM-based D&D simulation!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **‚úÖ Parameter Extraction**: Analyzed a real human campaign to extract player count and structure\n",
    "2. **‚úÖ Character Creation**: Generated AI characters with distinct personalities and classes\n",
    "3. **‚úÖ Turn Sampling**: Created a realistic turn sequence using uniform sampling\n",
    "4. **‚úÖ Memory Management**: Each character maintained context and memory across turns\n",
    "5. **‚úÖ Interactive Gameplay**: Characters responded to situations and each other naturally\n",
    "6. **‚úÖ Session Management**: Complete game log with timestamps and turn tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features Demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-agent LLM system**: Each character has their own Claude client\n",
    "- **Memory persistence**: Characters remember past events and update their knowledge\n",
    "- **Turn-based interaction**: Realistic D&D-style turn sequence\n",
    "- **Extensible architecture**: Easy to add new sampling methods, character extraction, etc.\n",
    "- **Real campaign integration**: Parameters derived from actual human gameplay\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **üîÆ Extract character data**: Pull actual character names/classes from human campaigns\n",
    "- **üìà Advanced sampling**: Implement activity-based or weighted turn sampling\n",
    "- **üß† Enhanced memory**: Add verbatim recent events + summarized older events\n",
    "- **üé™ Richer scenarios**: Create more complex, multi-scene adventures\n",
    "- **üìä Analysis tools**: Compare AI gameplay patterns to human campaigns\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation framework is now ready for more sophisticated experiments with emergent AI behavior in D&D settings!"
