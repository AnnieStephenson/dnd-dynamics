She comes from a long line of female warriors and guardians in her clan. Jinx is eager to prove herself and fight evil, sometimes to the point of recklessness. She has a strong sense of justice and duty, and little patience for those she sees as unworthy or dishonorable. Despite her serious demeanor, Jinx shows flashes of humor and camaraderie with her fellow guardians.\n",

Faen grew up isolated and sheltered by her noble family, who were ashamed of her perceived magical weakness. She eventually made a pact with Bastion to gain power, leading to exile from her family. Faen is eager to prove herself but lacks confidence, often deferring to others. She's fascinated by magic and knowledge, but struggles with social interactions.
