Jinx reveres Ximesi, the sage of mountains deity of light and fire, drawing strength and purpose from her belief. Her upbringing among the mountain-dwelling clans imbued her with a love for tradition, a fiery determination, and an unwavering resolve to rid her homeland of the pervasive darkness. She comes from a line of fierce female warriors and views herself as a torchbearer, destined to continue the legacy of protection and healing. Her interactions are driven by a sense of camaraderie and duty. Despite her confidence, she shows respectful disdain for unnecessary delays and distractions, often urging her companions to remain focused on their noble task.\n",

      "  🗡️  Faen (Warlock): Faral \"Faen\" Hanali, a Moon Elf Warlock, embodies both vulnerability and strength. Born into nobility and often perceived as an outcast due to her frailty and peculiar traits, Faen seeks acceptance and validation, particularly through her pact with an enigmatic voice she affectionately names Bastion. Her desire to protect the marginalized echoes her complicated past filled with familial disapproval. Though burdened by her past, she displays a curious and gentle nature, finding wonder in the unknown, such as her fascination with the pixie Teleya. Her interactions oscillate between timid politeness and moments of fiery assertiveness, particularly when empowered by her magic, which inadvertently reveals her inner struggles and need for approval.\n",

      "  🗡️  Dmitrei (Druid): Dmitrei Snowhunter is a stoic and resourceful human Druid, steeped in the primal vigor of the Aerith Tundra where he was raised. His life's simplicity is juxtaposed by his innate connection to nature, cultivated under the watchful eye of a mystical druidic mentor. The prophecy of aiding against a looming darkness serves as both his burden and legacy. Dmitrei exudes the steadfastness of a true guardian, employing his knowledge of the natural world and the mystical arts to bolster his party's efforts. He remains calm under duress, but is equally unyielding when it comes to protecting his teammates, seeing himself as both healer and protector, embracing the strength of the pack as his guiding philosophy.\n",

      "  🗡️  Thokk (Barbarian): Thokk is a robust and passionate half-orc Barbarian with a chaotic past marked by loss and rebellion. Born into a life of piracy with a fierce yet tender mother, Thokk learned the importance of kinship and survival. His mother's execution honed his worldview, casting justice not as law but as a balancing act of moral equivalence. In his new role as a guardian, Thokk grapples with self-imposed ideals of honor, seeking redemption from his past while struggling to trust the world's dichotomy of good and evil. His brute strength is tempered by an underlying sensitivity, evident in his attempts to connect with teammates like Faen. Thokk’s heart harbors resilience and complexity, a turbulent storm harnessed to protect those who cannot protect themselves.\n",
