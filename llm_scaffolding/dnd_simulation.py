        Be sure to separate the human player's personality from that of their character. 

        You may include:
        - Possible age range, gender identity, or background
        - Possible family or personal life details
        - Personality traits (e.g., introverted, playful, meticulous)
        - Writing style (e.g., descriptive, terse, humorous, lyrical)
        - Hobbies, interests, or career hints
        - Political or ethical leanings (if evidenced)
        - Social tendencies (e.g., leadership, collaboration, conflict-avoidance)

        For stats not explicitly mentioned, make reasonable inferences based on:

        - Spells they cast or abilities they use

        For some campaigns, the character sheet may include additional parameters containing qualitative questions and answers from the DM, such as "why are you here?" or "character background". If these aspects are provided, include them in your response.

        For each character, provide a complete character sheet in this exact format with no additional formatting characters such as ** or --. Simply skip a line at the end of each character sheet.:
